While work may seem like a drag for many, Common Ground is quite the contrary bringing out the best in you with it's great atmosphere, well decked interiors and professional team that resonates with so much warmth you'll feel right at home. Actually, Common Ground is home to me and my team. In my opinion, you'll NEVER find a team of people so dedicated to making your work-space work for you - and the coffee is great too. The ironic truth is that there is nothing 'common' about these grounds. They are in fact a gem of a find.</p>

                                        <p class="m-t-10">Many traditional businesses have perception that working in a co-working space is expensive and not worth it. But I genuinely save money by working in CG. After taking into consideration rental for a 2 year lease, in a location that is not central so that its cheaper, having to fit out the office internally, pay for all utilities, cleaning services, pantry items, maintenance and repairs, furniture etc, you will see that the cost per month shoots up a lot on top of your base rental rate. On top of that, our company can remain asset light, have admin for the office all taken care off, plus we get value from gym subscriptions, community events and partnerships. The value we get is more than just the rental fee, CG goes out of their way to help our team grow as a business. Their team is very personable and professional.</p>
